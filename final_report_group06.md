# COSC 301 Project Group 06

## Introduction

Our project is an analysis of a 2014 survey of employee mental health in tech workplaces. The survey interviewed over a thousand respondents and collected twenty seven points of data per respondent across many countries around the world. We are interested in this data as it pertains to our personal lives quite a bit, as each of us are going into tech or tech-related fields and have had struggles with mental health in the past.
