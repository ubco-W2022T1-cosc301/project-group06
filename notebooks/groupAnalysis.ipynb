    "Overall it seems that there is no significant correlation between the age of a tech worker and their willingness to seek treatment for and discuss mental health issues. In fact, it seems that Boomer and Gen X workers are more likely to seek treatment than Millennial and Gen Z which contradicts my expectations. Gen Z workers also appear less likely to discuss mental health issues with their supervisor than any other generation. While this may be a trend with Gen Z workers, it may also be a result of not having enough Gen Z workers answer the survey. The same can be said for Boomer workers, as those generations are the make up the least amount of workers who answered the survey. Overall, this was an enlightening analysis showing that while the survey was conducted, there is no evidence that the older generations are more stigmatized against mental health issues than younger generations"
